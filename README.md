## About this Specialization

The Machine Learning Specialization is a foundational online program created in collaboration between DeepLearning.AI and Stanford <br>
Online. This beginner-friendly program will teach you the fundamentals of machine learning and how to use these techniques to build<br>
real-world AI applications.

This Specialization is taught by Andrew Ng, an AI visionary who has led critical research at Stanford University and groundbreaking work at<br>
Google Brain, Baidu, and Landing.AI to advance the AI field.

This 3-course Specialization is an updated version of Andrew’s pioneering Machine Learning course, rated 4.9 out of 5 and taken by over <br>
4.8million learners since it launched in 2012.

It provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression,<br>
neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the<br>
best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a<br>
data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)

By the end of this Specialization, you will have mastered key concepts and gained the practical know-how to quickly and powerfully apply<br>
machine learning to challenging real-world problems. If you’re looking to break into AI or build a career in machine learning, the new<br>
Machine Learning Specialization is the best place to start.

## Applied Learning Project

By the end of this Specialization, you will be ready to:

- Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including <br>
  linear regression and logistic regression.
- Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification.
- Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world.
- Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.
- Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection.
- Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.
- Build a deep reinforcement learning model.
